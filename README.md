# Project-Image-caption-generator

An image caption generator is a system that automatically generates textual descriptions or captions for images. The model was trained on flicker dataset available on kaggle.
Here pre-trained VGG16 model is used. The dataset consist of 6000 images used to train the model and rest to test and validate.
I validated the caption predicted by my trained model using Bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) BLEU is a well-acknowledged metric to measure the similarly of one hypothesis sentence to multiple reference sentences.
